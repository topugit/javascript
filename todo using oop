Todo app project
In this project, you will write the class that powers a Todo app. The provided code in the index.js is related to the DOM which you'll learn how to implement in the DOM chapters.

We've already provided an empty class Todos.

We've mostly seen examples of constructors that capture their parameters. However, this constructor does not need to capture anything. Its constructor defines an instance variable todos as an array of objects. We've included 2 example todos so that you can visualize the structure of every todo object.

You need to implement 7 instance methods so that the app works. As soon as you've got the first 2 methods implemented, you will be able to test them out in the browser tab.

1. getAll()
This method should return all the todos.

2. getCount()
This method should return a number representing the number of todos.

After implementing these 2 methods, you will be able to see the 2 sample todos rendered in the browser tab. Try inserting a new todo using the form. It will fail until you implement the next method.

3. add(title, category)
This method receives the title (string) and the category (string). It should add a new object into the existing array of objects, following the same format.
Once this method is implemented, you will be able to add todos using the form.

4. getWork()
This method should return an array of objects containing only the todos that have a work category.
The format of the objects inside the array should stay the same.

5. getWorkCount()
This method should return a number representing how many todos have the work category. try to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

You will now be able to filter todos by work category in the browser tab.

6. getPersonal()
This method should return an array of objects containing only the todos that have a personal category.
The format of the objects inside the array should stay the same.

7. getPersonalCount()
This method should return a number representing how many todos have the personal category. try to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

You will now be able to filter todos by personal category in the browser tab. Thus, the entire project is complete.

export default class Todos {
    // Do NOT modify the constructor
    constructor() {
        // we don't capture any parameters here
        // we're defining an array of todos with two example todos
        this.todos = [{
            title: "Learn JavaScript",
            category: "work"
        }, {
            title: "Meditate",
            category: "personal"
        }];
     
    }
     getAll(){
            return this.todos;
       }
    getCount(){
        return this.todos.length;
    }
    add(title, category) {
        this.todos.push({title, category});
    }
    getWork() {
        return this.todos.filter(todo => todo.category === "work");
    }
    getWorkCount() {
        return this.getWork().length;
    }
     getPersonal() {
        return this.todos.filter(todo => todo.category === "personal");
    }

    getPersonalCount() {
        return this.getPersonal().length;
    }
    
    // TODO: define remaining instance methods

}
